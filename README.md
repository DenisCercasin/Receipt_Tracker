## Goal

The aim of this project is to design and implement a fully functional Android application that enables users to scan receipts, automatically detect expense amounts, categorize spending, and analyze expenses through visual statistics.  
This project fulfills the requirements of the module by integrating multiple functionalities, Firebase database, user authentication, and a clean, user-friendly interface.

## Description

**Receipt Tracker** is an Android application that helps users manage their expenses efficiently.  
The app uses **ML Kitâ€™s offline OCR** to extract text from scanned receipts, detects amounts via **regular expressions**, and assigns categories automatically using keyword logic.  
All data is stored remotely using **Firebase Firestore** and can be viewed in detailed monthly statistics with **MPAndroidChart** visualizations.

**Main Features:**
- **Receipt Scanning:** Use the device camera to capture receipts.
- **Offline OCR Recognition:** ML Kitâ€™s on-device text recognition extracts amounts without an internet connection.
- **Automatic Categorization:** Assigns categories (e.g., Groceries, Fuel) based on keywords.
- **Remote Storage:** Firebase Firestore ensures secure and synchronized data storage.
- **Statistics Dashboard:** Pie chart & bar chart views of expenses per month.
- **Manual Entry:** Add expenses without scanning.
- **Login & Registration:** Secure user authentication.

## Target Users & Background Motivation

While there are many similar expense tracking apps, Receipt Tracker was designed with a specific target group in mind:  
citizens of **Moldova, Romania, and Ukraine**.  

Unlike Western European countries, these regions do not have many widely recognized, Europe-wide retail chains.  
This appâ€™s categorization and keyword recognition system is planned to be tailored for local shop names and receipt formats.  

For testing and academic submission purposes, the current version is adapted for Germany.  
In future iterations, it will be localized to meet the needs of the originally intended markets.
